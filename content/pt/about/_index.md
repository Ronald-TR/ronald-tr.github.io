Hi adventurer, my name is Ronald Rodrigues Farias. This is my personal blog, a place for me to talk about everything that i like, most of it will be focused in IT world, but not restricted to it.

Profissionally, i'm a **Software Engineer** since 2017. And a Bsc. in Computer Science, graduated by Kroton - Pitagoras since 2019.

I've been worked building softwares in some languages, such as javascript, delphi, lua, golang, dart/flutter and python, the last one is that i have a personal prediletism.
